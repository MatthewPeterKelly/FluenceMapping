# README.MD  --  Fluence Mapping Project

In radiation therapy for cancer treatment, there is a interesting math problem
known as *fluence mapping*: Given a desired radiation dose at a specific location
on the patient, compute the correct leaf trajectories and dose rate on the
multi-leaf collimator to match the desired dose at the patient.

The idea in this work is to represent the dose rate and leaf trajectories as
continuous time-varying functions.
