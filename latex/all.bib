  abstract={This paper reports on the analysis of intensity modulated radiation treatment optimization problems in the presence of non-convex feasible parameter spaces caused by the specification of dose\&ndash;volume constraints for the organs-at-risk (OARs). The main aim was to determine whether the presence of those non-convex spaces affects the optimization of clinical cases in any significant way. This was done in two phases: (1) Using a carefully designed two-dimensional mathematical phantom that exhibits two controllable minima and with randomly initialized beamlet weights, we developed a methodology for exploring the nature of the convergence characteristics of quadratic cost function optimizations (deterministic or stochastic). The methodology is based on observing the statistical behaviour of the residual cost at the end of optimizations in which the stopping criterion is progressively more demanding and carrying out those optimizations to very small error changes per iteration. (2) Seven clinical cases were then analysed with dose\&ndash;volume constraints that are stronger than originally used in the clinic. The clinical cases are two prostate cases differently posed, a meningioma case, two head-and-neck cases, a spleen case and a spine case. Of the 14 different sets of optimizations (with and without the specification of maximum doses allowed for the OARs), 12 fail to show any effect due to the existence of non-convex feasible spaces. The remaining two sets of optimizations show evidence of multiple minima in the solutions, but those minima are very close to each other in cost and the resulting treatment plans are practically identical, as measured by the quality of the dose\&ndash;volume histograms (DVHs). We discuss the differences between fluence maps resulting from those similar treatment plans. We provide a possible reason for the observed results and conclude that, although the study is necessarily limited, the annealing characteristics of a simulated annealing method may not be justified in clinical optimization in the presence of dose\&ndash;volume constraints. The results of optimizations by the Newton gradient (NG) method with a quadratic cost function are reported in detail. An adaptive simulated annealing method, optimizing the same function, and the dynamically penalized likelihood method, optimizing a log likelihood function, have also been used in the study. The results of the latter two methods have only been discussed briefly, as they yielded the same conclusions as the NG method. }

  abstract={The purpose of this study is to calculate Pareto surfaces in multi-criteria radiation treatment planning and to analyse the dependency of the Pareto surfaces on the objective functions used for the volumes of interest. We develop a linear approach that allows us to calculate truly Pareto optimal treatment plans, and we apply it to explore the tradeoff between tumour dose homogeneity and critical structure sparing. We show that for two phantom and two clinical cases, a smooth (as opposed to kinked) Pareto tradeoff curve exists. We find that in the paraspinal cases the Pareto surface is invariant to the response function used on the spinal cord: whether the mean cord dose or the maximum cord dose is used, the Pareto plan database is similar. This is not true for the lung studies, where the choice of objective function on the healthy lung tissue influences the resulting Pareto surface greatly. We conclude that in the special case when the tumour wraps around the organ at risk, e.g. prostate cases and paraspinal cases, the Pareto surface will be largely invariant to the objective function used to model the organ at risk. }

  abstract={We present a novel linear programming (LP) based approach for efficiently solving the intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fluence-map optimization (FMO) problem to global optimality. Our model overcomes the apparent limitations of a linear-programming approach by approximating any convex objective function by a piecewise linear convex function. This approach allows us to retain the flexibility offered by general convex objective functions, while allowing us to formulate the FMO problem as a LP problem. In addition, a novel type of partial-volume constraint that bounds the tail averages of the differential dose\&ndash;volume histograms of structures is imposed while retaining linearity as an alternative approach to improve dose homogeneity in the target volumes, and to attempt to spare as many critical structures as possible. The goal of this work is to develop a very rapid global optimization approach that finds high quality dose distributions. Implementation of this model has demonstrated excellent results. We found globally optimal solutions for eight 7-beam head-and-neck cases in less than 3 min of computational time on a single processor personal computer without the use of partial-volume constraints. Adding such constraints increased the running times by a factor of 2\&ndash;3, but improved the sparing of critical structures. All cases demonstrated excellent target coverage ($>$95\%), target homogeneity ($<$10\% overdosing and $<$7\% underdosing) and organ sparing using at least one of the two models. }

   Abstract = {In high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy, conventional dose optimization algorithms consider multiple objectives in the form of an aggregate function that transforms the multiobjective problem into a single-objective problem. As a result, there is a loss of information on the available alternative possible solutions. This method assumes that the treatment planner exactly understands the correlation between competing objectives and knows the physical constraints. This knowledge is provided by the Pareto trade-off set obtained by single-objective optimization algorithms with a repeated optimization with different importance vectors. A mapping technique avoids non-feasible solutions with negative dwell weights and allows the use of constraint free gradient-based deterministic algorithms. We compare various such algorithms and methods which could improve their performance. This finally allows us to generate a large number of solutions in a few minutes. We use objecti!
 ves expressed in terms of dose variances obtained from a few hundred sampling points in the planning target volume (PTV) and in organs at risk (OAR). We compare two- to four-dimensional Pareto fronts obtained with the deterministic algorithms and with a fast-simulated annealing algorithm. For PTV-based objectives, due to the convex objective functions, the obtained solutions are global optimal. If OARs are included, then the solutions found are also global optimal, although local minima may be present as suggested.},

   Abstract = {A multiobjective gradient-based algorithm has been developed for the purpose of dose distribution optimization in external beam conformal radiotherapy. This algorithm is based on the concept of gathering the values of all objectives into a single value. The weighting factors of the composite objective values are varied in different steps, allowing the reconstruction of the trade-off surfaces (three or more objectives) or curves (two objectives) which define the boundary between the feasible and non-feasible domain regions. The analysis of these curves allows the decision-maker to select the solution that best fits the clinical goals. In contrast to all the other algorithms, our method provides not a single solution but a sample of solutions representing all possible clinical importance factors (weights) for the objectives used. The application of this algorithm to two test cases shows that a correct selection for the importance factors to multiply the individu!
 al objectives in the global objective value is not trivial and that the location and shape of the boundary region between the feasible and non-feasible solution regions are case dependent. Provided that the individual objective functions are analytically differentiable and that the number of objectives is the range of two to three, the computation times are acceptable for clinical use. Furthermore, the optimization for a unique combination of importance factors within the aggregate objective function is performed in less than 1 min.},

   Abstract = {Machine-guided iterative optimization in radiation oncology requires ordinal or cardinal ranking of competing treatment plans. When the clinical objectives are multifaceted and incommensurable, the ranking formalism must take into account the decision maker's tradeoff strategies in a multidimensional decision space. To capture the decision processes in treatment planning, a multiobjective decision-theoretic scheme is formulated. Ranking among a group of candidate plans is based on a generalized distance metric. A dynamic metric weighting function is defined based on the state energy of the decision system, which is assumed to undergo thermodynamic cooling with iteration time. The decision maker is required to specify a baseline ranking of the objectives, which is taken to be the ground state of the decision system. This decision-theoretic formalism was applied to idealized cases in stereotactic radiosurgery and prostatic implantation, using the genetic algorithm as the optimization engine. The optimization pathways and the outcome at limited horizons indicated that the combined scheme of decision-theoretic steering and iterative optimization was robust and produced treatment plans consistent with the user's expectation. The effect of treatment uncertainties was simulated using imperfect objectives; however, certain recurring plans could be identified as optimized baseline solutions. Overall, the present formalism provides a realistic alternative to complete utility assessment or human-guided exploration of the efficient solution set.},

   Abstract = {Modern treatment planning systems for three-dimensional treatment planning provide three-dimensionally accurate dose distributions for each individual patient. These data open up new possibilities for more precise reporting and analysis of doses actually delivered to irradiated organs and volumes of interest. A new method of summarizing and reporting inhomogeneous dose distributions is reported here. The concept of equivalent uniform dose (EUD) assumes that any two dose distributions are equivalent if they cause the same radiobiological effect. In this paper the EUD concept for tumors is presented, for which the probability of local control is assumed to be determined by the expected number of surviving clonogens, according to Poisson statistics. The EUD can be calculated directly from the dose calculation points or, from the corresponding dose-volume distributions (histograms). The fraction of clonogens surviving a dose of 2 Gy (SF2) is chosen to be the prima!
 ry operational parameter characterizing radiosensitivity of clonogens. The application of the EUD concept is demonstrated on a clinical dataset. The causes of flattening of the observed dose-response curves become apparent since the EUD concept reveals the finer structure of the analyzed group of patients in respect to the irradiated volumes and doses actually received. Extensions of the basic EUD concept to include nonuniform density of clonogens, dose per fraction effects, repopulation of clonogens, and inhomogeneity of patient population are discussed and compared with the basic formula.},

   Abstract = {During external beam radiotherapy, normal tissues are irradiated along with the tumor. Radiation therapists try to minimize the dose of normal tissues while delivering a high dose to the target volume. Often this is difficult and complications arise due to irradiation of normal tissues. These complications depend not only on the dose but also on volume of the organ irradiated. Lyman has suggested a four-parameter empirical model which can be used to represent normal tissue response under conditions of uniform irradiation to whole and partial volumes as a function of the dose and volume irradiated. In this paper, Lyman's model has been applied to a compilation of clinical tolerance data developed by Emami et al. The four parameters to characterize the tissue response have been determined and graphical representations of the derived probability distributions are presented. The model may, therefore, be used to interpolate clinical data to provide estimated normal!

  abstract = {In radiation therapy one is confronted with the task of formulating
	a treatment plan which delivers a specified dose to a tumour but
	avoids irreparable damage to surrounding uninvolved structures. Radiation
	therapy treatment planning (RTTP) involves an inverse and a forward
	problem. The inverse problem is to devise a treatment plan, i.e.
	a radiation beam configuration and beam weighting, which provides
	a specified dose distribution to the delineated region. The forward
	problem is to calculate the dose distribution within the patient
	that results from the weighted radiation beam configuration. Since
	no analytic closed-form mathematical formulation of the forward operator
	exists, the inverse problem actually calls for computerised inversion
	of data. This inversion is achieved by constructing a fully discretised
	model that leads to a system of linear inequalities. These inequalities
	are solved either by a row-action method or a block-Cimmino algorithm
	which allows the assignment of weights within each block of inequalities.},
