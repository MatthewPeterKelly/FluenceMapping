\section{Introduction}
The optimal dynamic delivery of a given fluence map remains a difficult, largely unsolved problem, due to its inherent nonconvexity.
The nonconvexity of the fluence map matching problem leads to a large number of local minima.
Many methods simply ignore this crucial aspect of the problem, and others use a multi-start procedure to find several local minima and return the best one found.
For a thorough introduction to the complexities of dynamic fluence map delivery (which generally arises in the context of volumetric modulated arc therapy, VMAT),
see \cite{balvertcraft} and \cite{unkvmatreview}.

In this technical note, we investigate a regularization procedure which represents leaf trajectories and dose rates as low-order polynomial splines\footnotemark,
such that the optimization procedure naturally focuses on global aspects of the leaf trajectory/dose rate solution.

\subsection{Testing Figures}

\MPKcomment{Koos: I put this section in to make sure that I could get the test figures to compile in the main document.
            I'm not sure where they are actually supposed to go.}
\KvAcomment{The minibixel exposure figure is not really needed anymore. In the administered dose function, I have now illustrated the dose administered to a position x. 
A minibixel is just an interval, so the dose delivered to a certain minibixel is just the integral of administered dose over that interval.
The figure assumes that leaves start and end at the same position, $s$ and $e$, respectively. It basically illustrates (\ref{eqn:deliveredFluenceDose}).}

\begin{equation}
y = e^x

\end{equation}
\todo{Use the correct equation here?}

In this section we have a figure about minibixel exposure \ref{fig:minibixelExposure} and about administered dose \ref{fig:administeredDose}.

\subsection{Fluence Mapping as Continuous Optimization}

Our goal is to compute the optimal leaf trajectories $x_L(t)$ and $x_U(t)$, as well as the optimal dose rate $r(t)$ of the radiation source.
For this initial study we will consider only a single leaf pair, although our algorithm is structured such that it could be applied to an arbitrary number of leaf pairs.

\MPKcomment{What does the following mean?  {\em REMARK: assuming independence of rows, so no tongue-and-groove effect.}}
\KvAcomment{The leaves are coupled using a so called tongue-and-groove system. 
If the ends two adjacent left (or right) are at different positions, the tongue of one of the leaves blocks out a part of field of the other leaf pair, leading to underdosage in that row. 
We need to neglect the tongue-and-groove effect to be able to optimize the delivery of every fluence row independently.
Minor thing, but should be noted.}

We will assume that the desired fluence dose at each point $q(x)$ on the subject is given.
The optimization is given below, where $q'(x)$ is the fluence dose that is delivered by the
dose rate and leaf trajectories and $X$ is the position domain of the fluence map.

\begin{equation}
\underset{r(t), \, x_L(t), \, x_U(t)}{\operatorname{argmin}}
\int_X \bigg(q'(x)) - q(x)\bigg)^2 dx
\label{eqn:fluenceMapOptimization}
\end{equation}

The fluence dose at each location can be computed as

\begin{equation}
q'(x) = \int_{T(x)} r(t) dt
\label{eqn:deliveredFluenceDose}
\end{equation}

where $T(x)$ is the set of times when the position $x$ is not blocked by the leaves:
$T(x)$ is the set of all times $t$ such that $ x_L(t) < x < x_U(t)$.


% We will also assume that the leaves start next to each other:
% $x_L(0) = x_U(0)$ and
% $x_L(T) = x_U(T)$ where
% $t \in [0, T]$.

\MPKcomment{Should we assume that the leaf boundary conditions are known?
            Do the leaves need to start and end together?}
\KvAcomment{Matthew: Do you mean boundaries on the physical location of the leaves? 
            If so, we can assume that both leaf ends will stay within the treatment field (so if the fluence profile is given on [a,b], the leaves should stay right of a and left of b).
            It can be suboptimal to start the leaves together, but I'm not sure if we should care too much in this project.
            David, what do you think?}
