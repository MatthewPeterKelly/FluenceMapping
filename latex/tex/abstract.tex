  We consider the problem of matching a given fluence map $f$ to a close approximation in
  limited time $T$ by the use of a multi-leaf collimator,
  i.e. the setting of IMRT and VMAT in radiation therapy.
  We use linear splines for leaf position and the dose rate as functions of time.
  The optimization computes the dose-rate and leaf trajectories that produce the best
  match for the target fluence map.
  Computing the dose-rate and leaf trajectories is a difficult optimization problem
  with many local minima.
  In our optimization we use a smooth model of how the leaves block the fluence radiation,
  which help speed computation and avoid local minima.
  We solve the optimization in two parts: an inner optimization computes the optimal leaf trajectories,
  given a dose-rate trajectory; an outer optimization computes the dose-rate trajectory that
  minimizes the fitting error across all inner leaf-trajectory optimizations.
