# Direct Collocation

### Method:
The rough idea here is to use orthogonal collocation. The inverse
of the position trajectory is stored as an additional decision variable
and an equality constraint is then used to enforce the inverse 
relationship.

### Results:
It is possible that there is a bug, or that the method is just not
numerically sound.
